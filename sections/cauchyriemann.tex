\begin{qualproblem}[Fall 2019.C6]
    Suppose that $f$ and $\ol{f}$ are both analytic functions on a connected open set $U \sq \C$. Prove that $f$ is constant on $U$.
\end{qualproblem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$. Then, $\ol{f}(x + iy) = u(x,y) - iv(x,y)$. By assumption, $f$ is analytic on $U$ meaning that all first-order partials of $u$ and $v$ exist, are continuous, and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann (\refthm{cauchy-riemann}) equations. That is, $u_x = v_y$ and $u_y = -v_x$ on $U$.\\

    Likewise, $\ol{f}$ is analytic on $U$ and so the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply that $u_x = -v_y$ and $u_y = v_x$ on $U$. It can now be seen that $v_y = -v_y$ and $v_x = -v_x$. That is, $v_y = v_x = 0$. Similarly, $u_x = u_y = 0$. This means that
        \[f'(z) = u_x + iv_x = 0\]
    on $U$, therefore implying \marginnote{Should prove that $f'(z) \equiv 0$ implies that $f$ is constant --- would be a good exercise.} that $f$ is constant on $U$.
\end{proof}
