\begin{qualproblem}[Spring 2020.C5]
    Suppose that $f$ is analytic in a domain containing $|z|\leq 1$. If $|f(z)|\leq 1$ for each $|z|\leq 1$, show that $f$ has at least one fixed point in $|z|\leq 1$. That is, prove there exists a point $p$ with $|p|\leq1$ and $f(p) = p$.

\begin{qualproblem}[Spring 2020.C6]
    Let $f$ be an entire function such that at each point of $\C$ some derivative of $f$ is zero. Prove that $f$ is a polynomial.

\begin{qualproblem}[Spring 2020.C7]
    Compute the integral:

    \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{x}(1+x^2)}dx\]
    
\end{qualproblem}

\begin{qualproblem}[Spring 2020.C8]
    Suppose that $f$ is analytic in the unit disk with a zero of order $m \geq 2$ at $z=0$. Let 
        \[g = \frac{f'''}{f'} - \frac{3}{2}\left( \frac{f''}{f'} \right)^2 \]

    Prove that in a neighborhood of $z=0$, $g$ has a Laurent expansion of the form 
        \[g(z) = \sum_{k=-2}^\infty a_kz^k\]
    with
        \[a_{-2} = \frac{1}{2}(1-m^2)\]
