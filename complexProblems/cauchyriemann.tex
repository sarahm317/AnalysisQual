\section{The Cauchy-Riemann Equations}

\begin{qualproblem}[Fall 2019.C6]
    Suppose that $f$ and $\ol{f}$ are both analytic functions on a connected open set $U \sq \C$. Prove that $f$ is constant on $U$.
\end{qualproblem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$. Then, $\ol{f}(x + iy) = u(x,y) - iv(x,y)$. By assumption, $f$ is analytic on $U$ meaning that all first-order partials of $u$ and $v$ exist, are continuous, and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann (\refthm{cauchy-riemann}) equations. That is, $u_x = v_y$ and $u_y = -v_x$ on $U$.\\

    Likewise, $\ol{f}$ is analytic on $U$ and so the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply that $u_x = -v_y$ and $u_y = v_x$ on $U$. It can now be seen that $v_y = -v_y$ and $v_x = -v_x$. That is, $v_y = v_x = 0$. Similarly, $u_x = u_y = 0$. This means that
        \[f'(z) = u_x + iv_x = 0\]
    on $U$, therefore implying \marginnote{Should prove that $f'(z) \equiv 0$ implies that $f$ is constant --- would be a good exercise.} that $f$ is constant on $U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{qualproblem}[Spring 2017.C6]
    Prove that if $f(z)$ is an analytic function, then $\ol{f}(\ol{z})$ is also an analytic function.
\end{qualproblem}

\begin{proof}
    Write $f(z) = f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$. Then, $\ol{f}(\ol{z}) = u(x,-y) - iv(x,-y)$. Define $\tilde{u}(x,y) = u(x,-y)$ and $\tilde{v}(x,y) = -v(x,-y)$. Through Chain Rule, we see that all first-order partials of $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ exist, are continuous, and can be computed by 
        \[\tilde{u}_x(x,y) = u_x(x,y), \quad \tilde{u}_y(x,y) = -u_y(x,y),
        \quad \tilde{v}_x(x,y) = -v_x(x,y), \quad \tilde{v}_y(x,y) = v_y(x,y).\]
    By assumption, $f$ is analytic and therefore the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply
        \[u_x = v_y \quad u_y = -v_x.\]
    Then,
        \[\tilde{u}_x = u_x = v_y = \tilde{v}\]
    and
        \[\tilde{u}_y = -u_y = v_x = -\tilde{v}_x.\]
    Therefore, the Cauchy Riemann equations prove that $\ol{f}(\ol{z})$ is also an analytic function.
